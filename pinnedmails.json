    "content": "Hi Dennis,\n\nAfter the exciting Saturday, I guess you've been doing as good as that\nSaturday.　 The weather is good, food is good, and studying is good in this\nseason.　 I like this season the best.\n\nOh, well, this introduction may remind you of students' writing, so I\nshould stop it now.　 To make a long story short (or the introduction　\nshort?), I am sending you this message to say thank you.　 I said so for　\nthe Saturday already.　 Today's \"thank you\" is to the vocabulary test,　\nwhich was delivered to me today.　 On the letter from Professor Tanaka,　\nyour name was also written, so I assume that you and Prof. Tanaka　\nworked together to develop this test.　 To tell you the truth, I like it, and I　\ndo want to use it for my research and classes.　 He said that an online　\ndelivery is being planned.　 I wonder if anyone can use the test.　 If so, this　\nis really great.\n\nSending you a thank-you message, I would like to ask you a favor.　 The\nattached is a thank-you letter to　 Prof. Tanaka.　 Would it be too much to\nask you to print it out and hand it to him?　 If so, would you send me back\na \"Do it yourself\" message.　 I'll send it by regular mail.　 Or would you let　\nme know his mail address.　 (I hope he is a regular mail user.　 In our school,\nthere are still quite a few senior professors who don't use e-mail at all.\nYes, AT ALL!　 Can you believe that?)\n\nOK, Dennis, sorry for interrupting you with my favor.　 Hope to see you\nsoon again.　\n\nBest wishes,\n\nReemaa",

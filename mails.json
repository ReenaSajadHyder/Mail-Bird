Hope all's well in your world!　\n\nI haven't been to JALT all year, shame on me, but I needed the break.\nI still see the guys and I'm going to the national, so don't write me off\nyet!\n\nI was trying to remember who you've published with in the past, and I\nwondered if you had any contacts at Nan'Un-Do. I want to send a\nproposal to them but have no names, and the personal touch is always\nbest!\n\nI might go to see Jane Willis, family commitments permitting, any plans in\nthat direction? Going to Shizuoka I presume?\n\nBye for now\nAll the best\nR",
